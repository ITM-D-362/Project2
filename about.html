	    <p>ISUD is a society of scholars, mostly philosophers, from many parts of the world, devoted 
		to promoting international dialogue and the discussion of fundamental questions of universal 
		concern, which affect all humanity, such as world peace, human rights, dialogical interrelations 
		of diverse cultures, and preservation of the world ecology.</p>
		<ul>Fundamental Questions:</ul>
		  <li>What role does philosophical thinking have to play in moving toward a more rational and more 
		  humane future?</li>
		  <li>What are ethical principles of dialogue?</li>
		  <li>How may one understand cultural diversity and universality?</li>
		  <li>How best to work toward a culture of peace?</li>
		  <li>What is the relationship between the basic liberties of individuals and the collective rights 
		  of cultural groups?</li>

			<h3>of the</h3>
			<h3>International Society for Universal Dialogue</h3>
		  </section>
		  <section id="intro" class="text">
		    <p>We the Members of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, in order to investigate and 
			articulate the basic principles of universality systematically, rationally, and comprehensively—working 
			to promote a world-wide understanding of these principles, striving to help generate universal world-consciousness 
			towards the gradual emergence of a decent world order, and aspiring to actualize the highest and richest human values 
			in art, science, politics, education, and social life—do agree to declare the following statement as the constitution 
			of the International Society for Universal Dialogue.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a1" class="text">
		    <p>Article I</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a1t" class="text">
		    <p>The official name of the society shall be “The International Society for Universal Dialogue” to be 
			incorporated in the state of Maine, USA.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a2" class="text">
		    <p>Article II</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a2t" class="text">
		    <p>Scholars, especially philosophers, from all the countries of the world without exception, are entitled 
			to membership in the Society without any discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, nationality, religion, 
			sexual preference, or social class. The democratic way of thinking and acting shall be the guiding principle of all 
			decisions which determine the plans and projects of the Society.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a3" class="text">
		    <p>Article III</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a3t" class="text">
		    <p>The ISUD acknowledges that it was the idea of Universalism that gathered the Society together in Warsaw in November, 
			1989; and further acknowledges and honors its close relationship with the publication Dialogue and Universalism which 
			provides a forum in which all members of ISUD have the opportunity to communicate and exchange their views.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a4" class="text">
		    <p>Article IV</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a4t1" class="text">
		    <p>1. The main purpose of the Society is to promote, in theory and in practice, the ideals of universality as the most 
			effective means for the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world order. To achieve this purpose, the 
			members of ISUD shall try—by means of scholarly work, regional and international conferences, as well as personal and 
			collective work —to explore and share important areas of human knowledge and experience.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a4t2" class="text">
		    <p>2. More specifically, the purpose of the Society is to evoke and invigorate a global consciousness; that is, the 
			existential awareness that all the peoples of the world belong to one species, the human species, and accordingly 
			have the same fundamental stock of needs, aspirations, and capacities. This involves the recognition that these needs, 
			aspirations, and capacities cannot be adequately realized under conditions of selfish competition, violence, and 
			exploitation but under conditions of peace, cooperation, and freedom. It also involves recognition of the responsibility 
			to other species, and to the preservation and restoration of the health and beauty of all eco-systems on the planet.</p>

		  <section id="a5" class="text">
		    <p>Article V</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a5t1" class="text">
		    <p>1. The Society shall be administered by a body of governors called the Board of the International Society of Universal 
			Dialogue (ISUD); and it shall operate in concert with this Constitution, and with the decisions made by the ISUD General 
			Assembly that meets prior to the tenure of a new Board.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a5t2a" class="text">
		    <p>2. The Board includes an executive committee composed of four officers: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer; 
			and it also includes a body of other members that number no fewer than six and no more than twelve. (So the full Board 
			shall be no fewer than ten and no more than sixteen, including officers.) Board members are elected for one cycle 
			(normally two years) to serve in a particular Board position, and have the possibility of being re-elected to one 
			additional term in the same position. However, there must be at least one intervening cycle for a Board member to be 
			reelected another time for the same position.</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a5t2b" class="text">
		    <p>(In some circumstances these term restrictions may be waived by vote of the General Assembly so as to sustain 
			regional representation and support the growth of the Society.)</p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="a5t3" class="text">
		    <p>3. All members of the Board shall be elected at the General Assembly by a majority vote. Only those who are

			reasons a given member might face removal. All such correspondence must be shared with the full Board, except the member facing 
			possible removal. Within two weeks of the initiation of such discussions, the member facing possible removal must be fully informed 
			of the reasons for possible removal, and be asked to make a response if desired within one week. Any such response must be shared 
			with all others on the Board, and discussed by them. Then within another week, a vote should be taken concerning removal of the 
			member. A two-thirds majority of the full Board (less the member facing removal) is necessary for removal from office.</p>
